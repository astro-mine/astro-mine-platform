"""Test helpers: build a valid ScenarioSpec and synthetic metric traces, with overrides.

Also the hosted-tier fixtures bench#29/#30 need: a **real** RSA keypair + JWKS + minted RS256
tokens (so the OIDC verifier is exercised with real crypto and no secret is ever committed), and a
fast in-process :class:`Sandbox` double for the leaderboard wiring tests — the *real*
:class:`~astro_mine.bench.sandbox.SubprocessSandbox` is exercised by ``tests/test_sandbox.py`` and
by the end-to-end hosted test, but paying a fresh interpreter per seed in every hosted test would
dominate the suite.

Not measured for coverage (coverage source is ``src/astro_mine``); kept out of ``tests`` as a
private module so it is not collected as a test.
