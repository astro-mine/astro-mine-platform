# Architecture

`astro-mine-worlds` is a component of the [Astro-Mine](https://github.com/astro-mine)
platform. Its architecture is specified in the platform **docs** repo, not here — this
file is the conventional pointer back to that source of truth
([`conventions.md` §13](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/conventions.md)).

- **Component design** —
  [`architecture/worlds.md`](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/worlds.md):
  celestial-body environment models (terrain, illumination/PSR, thermal, regolith);
  purpose, principles, runtime, data, integration, security, and roadmap alignment.
- **Cross-cutting standards** —
  [`architecture/conventions.md`](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/conventions.md):
  the platform-wide technology, schema, packaging, security, and versioning conventions
  every component follows.
- **System integration view** —
  [`architecture/system.md`](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/system.md):
  how the components fit together end to end.
