# Architecture

`astro-mine-core` is a component of the [Astro-Mine](https://github.com/astro-mine)
platform. Its architecture is specified in the platform **docs** repo, not here — this
file is the conventional pointer back to that source of truth
([`conventions.md` §13](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/conventions.md)).

- **Component design** —
  [`architecture/core.md`](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/core.md):
  purpose, principles, runtime, data, integration, security, and roadmap alignment for
  this package (the narrow waist — SADF, Environment/Policy APIs, message schemas, and
  the plugin registry).
- **Cross-cutting standards** —
  [`architecture/conventions.md`](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/conventions.md):
  the platform-wide technology, schema, packaging, security, and versioning conventions
  every component follows.
- **System integration view** —
  [`architecture/system.md`](https://github.com/astro-mine/docs/blob/main/architecture/system.md):
  how the components fit together end to end.
